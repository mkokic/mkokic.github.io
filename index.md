## About me
<img src="mia.jpg" alt="Mia" width="150" height="150">

I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technoloy, Robotics, Perception and Learning Lab and my supervisor is Danica Kragic. My research is about task-oriented robot grasping and manipulation as well as modelling hand-object interactions with a goal of transferring these to a robot. I develop methods and apply deep learning algorithms to teach a robot how to grasp and manipulate objects from simulation and from human demonstration.
