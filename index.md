## About me

I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technoloy, Robotics, Perception and Learning Lab and my supervisor is Danica Kragic. My research is about modelling hand-object interactions and robot grasping. Concretely, I develop methods and apply deep learning to teach a robot how to grasp and manipulate objects from simulation and from human demonstration.
